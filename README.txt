INSTRUCTIONS:
 Your feud with the neighboring Knight clan over who is more Honourable has reached a boiling point. In the dead of night,
   the two clans decide to attack and steal each other's flags. Your mission is simple: retrieve the enemy's flag without
   them retrieving yours first. You have two AI teammates at your disposal to help against the enemy terror. To retrive the
   flag, simply go to the enemy base and grab it. However, if you die with it, the enemies have a chance to bring it back to
   their base!
